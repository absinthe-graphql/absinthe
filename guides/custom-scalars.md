# Custom Scalar Types

One of the strengths of GraphQL is its extensibility---which doesn't end with
its object types, but is present all the way down to the scalar value level.

Sometimes it makes sense to build custom scalar types to better model your
domain. Here's how to do it.

The GraphQL Specification doesn't define date and datetime types, but Absinthe ships with several pre-built for use via [import_types](importing-types.md). In this example we'll look at how `:datetime` is defined.

## Defining a scalar

Supporting additional scalar types is as easy as using the `scalar` macro and
providing `parse` and `serialize` functions.

Here's the definition for `:datetime` from `Absinthe.Type.Custom`:

```elixir
@desc """
The `DateTime` scalar type represents a date and time in the UTC
timezone. The DateTime appears in a JSON response as an ISO8601 formatted
string, including UTC timezone ("Z"). The parsed date and time string will
be converted to UTC and any UTC offset other than 0 will be rejected.
"""
scalar :datetime, name: "DateTime" do
  serialize &DateTime.to_iso8601/1
  parse &parse_datetime/1
end

@spec parse_datetime(Absinthe.Blueprint.Input.String.t) :: {:ok, DateTime.t} | :error
@spec parse_datetime(Absinthe.Blueprint.Input.Null.t) :: {:ok, nil}
defp parse_datetime(%Absinthe.Blueprint.Input.String{value: value}) do
  case DateTime.from_iso8601(value) do
    {:ok, datetime, 0} -> {:ok, datetime}
    {:ok, _datetime, _offset} -> :error
    _error -> :error
  end
end
defp parse_datetime(%Absinthe.Blueprint.Input.Null{}) do
  {:ok, nil}
end
defp parse_datetime(_) do
  :error
end
```

Scalar definitions, created using the `scalar` macro from
`Absinthe.Schema.Notation`, are made up of two major elements:

- A function provided to `parse` that defines how input is converted
  from an [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree)
  value (an `Absinthe.Blueprint.Input.t`) to a value that's suitable
  for use in an argument and passed to a resolver.
- A function provided to `serialize` that defines how input is
  serialized back out when used as a result that should be sent back
  to the user.

In this example:

```graphql
mutation CreatePost {
  post(title: "Second", body: "We're off to a great start!", publishedAt: "2017-11-01T12:00:00Z") {
    id
    publishedAt
  }
}
```

If our schema defines a `:published_at` argument with the `:datetime` type:

```elixir
field :post, :post do
  arg :published_at, :datetime
  resolve fn _, args, _ ->
    # If the arg is provided, `args.published_at` will be a DateTime struct
    # ...
  end
end
```

Then, the value of the `publishedAt` GraphQL field ends up being
parsed by the `parse_datetime/1` function; it's been defined as the
parse function for the `:datetime` type using the `parse` macro.

The value, `"2017-11-01T12:00:00Z"`, will come into the function as an `%Absinthe.Blueprint.Input.String{}`, thanks to the hard work of the Absinthe parser and processing pipeline.

The `parse_datetime/1` function pulls the string value out of the
input, parses it with `DateTime.from_iso8601/1`, then returns the
correct result. That result will be used as the value of the
`:published_at` argument when it's passed to the `:post` field
resolver.

In the event of an error, the parse function can return either a lone
atom `:error` or error tuple e.g. `{:error, "Reason of error"}`. The
reason will be included in the output of the executed GraphQL document.

The serializer of `:datetime` is a pretty simple affair; it uses the
`DateTime.to_iso8601/1` utility function. It would be called to
serialize the `%DateTime{}` struct for the requested `:published_at`
field in the result.
