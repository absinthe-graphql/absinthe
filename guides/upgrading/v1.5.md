# Upgrading to v1.5

> This information is extracted and expanded from the CHANGELOG.

This version includes:
* Schema compilation phases
* SDL based schema definitions
* SDL rendering
* Telemetry based instrumentation

Existing macro-based schemas will work as-is, but make sure to note that the schema pipeline executes at compile time.

## Breaking changes

### Default values evaluated at compile time

Default values are evaluated at compile time. For example `default_value: DateTime.utc_now()` will have its time set at compile time. You probably don't want this :)

### Scalar output validation

Scalar outputs are now type checked and will raise exceptions if the result tries to send the wrong data type in the result.

### Field name validation

Added a schema phase to check the validity of field names according to GraphQL spec. Remove the `Absinthe.Phase.Schema.Validation.NamesMustBeValid` from the schema pipeline if you need to retain the previous behavior.

### `Absinthe.Subscription.PubSub`

Added `node_name/0` callback to `Absinthe.Subscription.PubSub` behaviour. To retain old behaviour, implement this callback to return `Kernel.node/0`.

### `Absinthe.Traversal`

Removed the un-used `Absinthe.Traversal` module.
