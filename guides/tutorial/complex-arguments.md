# Complex Arguments

In preparation for supporting comments on our blog, let's create users. We're building
a modern mobile first blog of course, and thus want to support either a phone number
or an email as the contact method for a user.

We want to support the following mutations.

Support creation of a user with their email address:

```graphql
mutation CreateEmailUser {
  createUser(
    contact: { type: EMAIL, value: "foo@bar.com" }
    name: "Jane"
    password: "hunter1"
  ) {
    id
    contacts {
      type
      value
    }
  }
}
```

And by using their phone number:

```graphql
mutation CreatePhoneUser {
  createUser(
    contact: { type: PHONE, value: "+1 123 5551212" }
    name: "Joe"
    password: "hunter2"
  ) {
    id
    contacts {
      type
      value
    }
  }
}
```

To do this we need the ability to create nested arguments. GraphQL has input objects
for this purpose. Input objects, like regular object, contain key value pairs, but
they are intended for input only (you can't do circular references with them for example).

Another notion we'll look at here is an enumerable type. We only want to support contact
types `"email"` and `"phone"` at the moment, and GraphQL gives us the ability to
specify this in our schema.

Let's start with our `:contact_type` Enum. In `blog_web/schema/account_types.ex`:

```graphql
enum :contact_type do
  value :phone, as: "phone"
  value :email, as: "email"
end
```

We're using the `:as` option here to make sure the parsed enum is represented by a string
when it's passed to our controllers; this is to ease integration with our Ecto schema
(by default, the enum values are passed as atoms).

Now if a user tries to send some other kind of contact type they'll
get a nice error without any extra effort on your part. Enum types are
not a substitute for modeling layer validations however, be sure to
still enforce things like this on that layer too.

Now for our contact input object.

In `blog_web/schema/account_types.ex`:

```graphql
input_object :contact_input do
  field :type, non_null(:contact_type)
  field :value, non_null(:string)
end
```

Note that we name this type `:contact_input`. Input object types have
their own names, and the `_input` suffix is common.

Finally our schema, in `blog_web/schema.ex`:

```elixir
mutation do

  #... other mutations

  @desc "Create a user"
  field :create_user, :user do
    arg :name, non_null(:string)
    arg :contact, non_null(:contact_input)
    arg :password, non_null(:string)

    resolve &Resolvers.Accounts.create_user/3
  end

end
```

Suppose in our database that we store contact information in a different database
table. Our mutation would be used to create both records in this case.

There does not need to be a one to one correspondence between how data is structured
in your underlying data store and how things are presented by your GraphQL API.

Our resolver, `blog_web/resolvers/accounts.ex` might look something like this:

```elixir
def create_user(_parent, args, %{context: %{current_user: %{admin: true}}}) do
  Blog.Accounts.create_user(args)
end
def create_user(_parent, args, _resolution) do
  {:error, "Access denied"}
end
```

You'll notice we're checking for `:current_user` again in our Absinthe
context, just as we did before for posts. In this case we're taking
the authorization check a step further and verifying that only
administrators (in this simple example, an administrator is a user
account with `:admin` set to `true`) can create a user.

Everyone else gets an `"Access denied"` error for this field.

Here's our mutation in action in GraphiQL.

## Next Step

Now let's [wrap things up](conclusion.md).
