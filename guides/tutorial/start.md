# Getting Started

We'll be building a very basic GraphQL API for a blog, written in Elixir using
Absinthe.

## Background

Before you start, it's a good idea to have some background into GraphQL in general. Here are a few resources that might be helpful:

- The official [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) website
- [How to GraphQL](https://www.howtographql.com/) (this includes another [brief tutorial](https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-elixir/0-introduction/) using Absinthe)

## The Example

 The tutorial expects you to have a properly set-up [Phoenix application](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html) with [absinthe](https://hex.pm/packages/absinthe) and [absinthe_plug](https://hex.pm/packages/absinthe_plug) added to the dependencies.

>  If you'd like to cheat, you can find the finished code for the tutorial
>  in the [Absinthe Example](https://github.com/absinthe-graphql/absinthe_tutorial)
>  project on GitHub.

## First Step

Let's get started with [our first query](our-first-query.md)!
