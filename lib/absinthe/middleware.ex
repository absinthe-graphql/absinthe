defmodule Absinthe.Middleware do
  @moduledoc """
  Middleware enables custom resolution behaviour on a field.

  All resolution happens through middleware. Even `resolve` functions are
  middleware, as the `resolve` macro is just

  ```
  quote do
    middleware Absinthe.Resolution, unquote(function_ast)
  end
  ```

  Resolution happens by reducing a list of middleware spec onto an
  `%Absinthe.Resolution{}` struct.

  ## Example

  ```
  defmodule MyApp.Web.Authentication do
    @behaviour Absinthe.Middleware

    def call(resolution, _config) do
      case resolution.context do
        %{current_user: _} ->
          resolution
        _ ->
          resolution
          |> Absinthe.Resolution.put_result({:error, "unauthenticated"})
      end
    end
  end
  ```

  By specifying `@behaviour Absinthe.Middleware` the compiler will ensure that
  we provide a `def call` callback. This function takes an
  `%Absinthe.Resolution{}` struct and will also need to return one such struct.

  On that struct there is a `context` key which holds the absinthe context. This
  is generally where things like the current user are placed. For more
  information on how the current user ends up in the context please see our full
  authentication guide on the website.

  Our `call/2` function simply checks the context to see if there is a current
  user. If there is, we pass the resolution onward. If there is not, we update
  the resolution state to `:resolved` and place an error result.

  Middleware can be placed on a field in three different ways:

  1. Using the `Absinthe.Schema.Notation.middleware/2`
  macro used inside a field definition.
  2. Using the `middleware/3` callback in your schema.
  3. Returning a `{:middleware, middleware_spec, config}`
  tuple from a resolution function.

  ## The `middleware/2` macro

  For placing middleware on a particular field, it's handy to use
  the `middleware/2` macro.

  Middleware will be run in the order in which they are specified.
  The `middleware/3` callback has final say on what middleware get
  set.

  Examples

  `MyApp.Web.Authentication` would run before resolution, and `HandleError` would run after.
  ```
  field :hello, :string do
    middleware MyApp.Web.Authentication
    resolve &get_the_string/2
    middleware HandleError, :foo
  end
  ```

  Anonymous functions are a valid middleware spec. A nice use case
  is altering the context in a logout mutation. Mutations are the
  only time the context should be altered. This is not enforced.
  ```
  field :logout, :query do
    middleware fn res, _ ->
      %{res |
        context: Map.delete(res.context, :current_user),
        value: "logged out",
        state: :resolved
      }
    end
  end
  ```

  `middleware/2` even accepts local public function names. Note
  that `middleware/2` is the only thing that can take local function
  names without an associated module. If not using macros, use
  `{{__MODULE__, :function_name}, []}`
  ```
  def auth(res, _config) do
    # auth logic here
  end

  query do
    field :hello, :string do
      middleware :auth
      resolve &get_the_string/2
    end
  end
  ```

  ## The `middleware/3` callback

  `middleware/3` is a function callback on a schema. When you `use
  Absinthe.Schema` a default implementation of this function is placed in your
  schema. It is passed the existing middleware for a field, the field itself,
  and the object that the field is a part of.

  So for example if your schema contained:

  ```
  object :user do
    field :name, :string
    field :age, :integer
  end

  query do
    field :lookup_user, :user do
      resolve fn _, _ ->
        {:ok, %{name: "Bob"}}
      end
    end
  end

  def middleware(middleware, field, object) do
    middleware |> IO.inspect
    field |> IO.inspect
    object |> IO.inspect

    middleware
  end
  ```

  Given a document like:
  ```graphql
  { lookupUser { name }}
  ```

  `object` is each object that is accessed while executing the document. In our
  case that is the `:user` object and the `:query` object. `field` is every
  field on that object, and middleware is a list of whatever middleware
  spec have been configured by the schema on that field. Concretely
  then, the function will be called , with the following arguments:

  ```
  YourSchema.middleware([{Absinthe.Resolution, #Function<20.52032458/0>}], lookup_user_field_of_root_query_object, root_query_object)
  YourSchema.middleware([{Absinthe.Middleware.MapGet, :name}], name_field_of_user, user_object)
  YourSchema.middleware([{Absinthe.Middleware.MapGet, :age}], age_field_of_user, user_object)
  ```

  In the latter two cases we see that the middleware list is empty. In the first
  case we see one middleware spec, which is placed by the `resolve` macro used in the
  `:lookup_user` field.

  ### Default Middleware

  One use of `middleware/3` is setting the default middleware on a field.
  By default middleware is placed on a
  field that looks up a field by its snake case identifier, ie `:resource_name`.
  Here is an example of how to change the default to use a camel cased string,
  IE, "resourceName".

  ```
  def middleware(middleware, %{identifier: identifier} = field, object) do
    camelized =
      identifier
      |> Atom.to_string
      |> Macro.camelize

    new_middleware_spec = {{__MODULE__, :get_camelized_key}, camelized}

    Absinthe.Schema.replace_default(middleware, new_middleware_spec, field, object)
  end

  def get_camelized_key(%{source: source} = res, key) do
    %{res | state: :resolved, value: Map.get(source, key)}
  end
  ```

  There's a lot going on here so let's unpack it. We need to define a
  specification to tell Absinthe what middleware to run. The form we're using is
  `{{MODULE, :function_to_call}, options_of_middleware}`. For our purposes we're
  simply going to use a function in the schema module itself
  `get_camelized_key`.

  We then use the `Absinthe.Schema.replace_default/4` function to swap out the
  default middleware already present in the middleware list with the new one we
  want to use. It handles going through the existing list of middleware and
  seeing if it's using the default or if it has custom resolvers on it. If it's
  using the default, the function applies our newly defined middleware spec.

  Like all middleware functions, `:get_camelized_key` takes a resolution struct,
  and options. The options is the camelized key we generated. We get the
  camelized string from the parent map, and set it as the value of the
  resolution struct. Finally we mark the resolution state `:resolved`.

  Side note: This `middleware/3` function is called whenever we pull the type
  out of the schema. The middleware itself is run every time we get a field on
  an object. If we have 1000 objects and we were doing the camelization logic
  INSIDE the middleware, we would compute the camelized string 1000 times. By
  doing it in the `def middleware` callback we do it just once.

  ### Changes Since 1.3

  In Absinthe 1.3, fields without any `middleware/2` or `resolve/1` calls would
  show up with an empty list `[]` as its middleware in the `middleware/3`
  function. If no middleware was applied in the function and it also returned `[]`,
  THEN Absinthe would apply the default.

  This made it very easy to accidentally break your schema if you weren't
  particularly careful with your pattern matching. Now the defaults are applied
  FIRST by absinthe, and THEN passed to `middleware/3`. Consequently, the
  middleware list argument should always have at least one value. This is also
  why there is now the `replace_default/4` function, because it handles telling
  the difference between a field with a resolver and a field with the default.

  ### Object Wide Authentication

  Let's use our authentication middleware from earlier, and place it on every
  field in the query object.

  ```
  defmodule MyApp.Web.Schema do
    use Absinthe.Schema

    query do
      field :private_field, :string do
        resolve fn _, _ ->
          {:ok, "this can only be viewed if authenticated"}
        end
      end
    end

    def middleware(middleware, _field, %Absinthe.Type.Object{identifier: identifier})
    when identifier in [:query, :subscription, :mutation] do
      [MyApp.Web.Authentication | middleware]
    end
    def middleware(middleware, _field, _object) do
      middleware
    end
  end
  ```

  It is important to note that we are matching for the `:query`, `:subscription`
  or `:mutation` identifier types. We do this because the middleware function
  will be called for each field in the schema. If we didn't limit it to those
  types, we would be applying authentication to every field in the entire
  schema, even stuff like `:name` or `:age`. This generally isn't necessary
  provided you authenticate at the entrypoints.

  ## Main Points

  - Middleware functions take a `%Absinthe.Resolution{}` struct, and return one.
  - All middleware on a field are always run, make sure to pattern match on the
    state if you care.
